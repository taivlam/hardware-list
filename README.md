# Hardware List
This is a list of hardware that I recommend.

## Audio equipment
### In-ear monitors
This is not for a "pleasant" audio experience, but simply as definitely
better than "normal" earbuds with in-line mics for quick video calls.  I've
observed that the average earbuds can be a bit quiet when having an online
audio/video call, but IEMs are always loud enough, even on volume levels
extremely close to the lowest level (if not the lowest level).

Currently I use In-ear monitors (or [IEMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-ear_monitor)) from KZ Audio:
* I recommend the [KZ ZSN Pro](https://kz-audio.com/kz-zsn-pro.html) with mic.
    * Originally I was looking for the [KZ ZSN](https://kz-audio.com/kz-zsn.html), but somehow the confusion of Amazon brought me to the ZSN Pro.
* I also recommend the [KZ EDX Pro](https://kz-audio.com/kz-edx-pro.html) with mic.
    * Originally I was looking for the [KZ EDX](https://kz-audio.com/kz-edx.html), but again Amazon's confusion brought me to the KZ EDX Pro.

### USB microphone
This is when you want your audio on your online audio/video call to be
better than any in-line mic from earbuds/IEMs.  This is not intended to
be competing for podcast recording or other recording scenarios where
critical audio quality is the goal.

* [Blue Yeti](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/shop/p/yeti-premium-usb-microphone.988-000101) condenser microphone from Logitech.

## Video equipment
### USB webcam
This is when you want better video that can ever be provided from a
built-in laptop webcam.

* Logitech [C930e](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c930e-business-webcam.960-000971.html) webcam.
